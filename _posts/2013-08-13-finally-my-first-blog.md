title: Finally, my first personal blog!
---

Well, there it is, my first personal blog. I build web applications for all kind of customers but building one of my own is a whole different kind of story. I'm a very hard customer if I may say so. In the last couple of years I've taken several attempts to create my own personal site but none of them made it to the public. I'm a big fan of sharing knowledge and with this blog I will share mine.

### Time to start writing
I always had an excuse not to write blogs and share knowledge because I didn't have a blog, but I can't use that excuse anymore. I have to work on my writing skills so please be patient.

### The focus
I'm a Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.xebia.com" target="_blank">Xebia</a> with a Java background. The posts going to be technical with a lot of code snippets. I will not restrict the postings to Java because my interests are much broader than that. I hope you enjoy it and if you have any suggestions about the design, want to report bugs, want to see new features or anything else, please contact me.
